The fermat's last theorem is used in this program to calculate the "near miss" of the program using the formulas. the values of the n and k are 
asked by the user to enter it and then it will calculate the near miss.

intialising the n value to get the values from the user. after intialising the values then the k value is said to be 1.

the loops are iterated to get the error message. the error message is displayed when the k value is less than 10.

the next process is to calculate the near miss. the near miss is calculated with the formulas using the python program.


the steps to be followed by the users while entering the values:
		
Step 1:

the user is asked to enter the values of n that will be between 2 to 12
if the user enters more than 12 or less than 2 it will ask one more time to enter the values.

Step 2:

the next step is to enter the value of k and the value of k should be more than 10.
if the user enters below 10 then the program ask one more time to enter the value.

step 3:

if the user enters greater values, then the program displays the error message like "Overflow!!!"

Step 4:

after these process, the program displays the values of x,y,z, miss and relative miss.
